# ECSE211 Ballistic Launcher Project

This is your repository for the fifth lab as well as the project.
You must place your source files in the 
`src/ca/mcgill/ecse211/project/` folder, where `Main.java` is. Your source files
must all have the package declaration 

```java
package ca.mcgill.ecse211.project;
```

**Do not modify the other files in this repository without written permission!**

They are meant to help us (and you) with grading and reviewing the code. You can see the results
of `checkstyle` at

travis-ci.com/mcgill-ecse211-f19/project-ecse211_gXX

where XX is your group number. 

You may also run `checkstyle` locally before you commit by running

```bash
./gradlew checkstyle
```

on your local machine from the repo root directory.

You can run SpotBugs locally using the Eclipse
[plugin](https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/spotbugs-eclipse-plugin).
